The **Nubank Puzzle** is a short modeling assignment that is typical of some of the work we do at Nubank. 

We host a ZIP archive [here](https://s3-sa-east-1.amazonaws.com/nu-static/workable-data-science/data-science-puzzle.zip) that contains 3 CSV files: **train.csv**, **test.csv**, and **sample_submission.csv**. **train.csv** contains a column called `id` which uniquely identifies each row, several columns identified by hexadecimal strings, and a column `target` which we would like for you to predict. Columns that contain SHA-256 hashes for their values represent categorical variables, while the rest of the variables are numeric. **test.csv** has the same column names and data types as **train.csv**, but it is missing the `target` column. There are no missing values or data corruption problems in either of these files. Do not worry about the meanings of the variables or the metadata -- this is an artificial dataset.
